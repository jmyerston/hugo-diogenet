The first text that we are studying is the Βίοι φιλοσόφων (*Lives of Philosophers* or, better, *Ways of Life of Philosophers*) of Diogenes Laertius.Diogenes Laertius is virtually unknown as a person, even his precise name---whether it should be written "Diogenes Laertius" or "Laertius Diogenes". The dates and of his birth and death, and the places of these and where he lived and worked are also unknown.Scholars have inferred from the sources that he mentions, and fails to mention, that Laertius probably wrote in the first half of the third century CE. *Lives of Philosophers* has been described as "the earliest history of Greek philosophy to have come down to us, constituting a valuable source of information about the lives and doctrines of the major representatives of ancient philosophical schools up to the 1^st^ century CE" (Dorandi 2015).*Lives of Philosophers* consists of ten books, all of which survive, except the end of the book on the Stoics (Book 7). The work is roughly organized according to Laertius' conception of two independent lines of philosophical succession: an "Ionic" one stemming from Thales of Miletus, and an "Italian" one stemming from Phercydes of Syros. Two of the books are devoted to individual philosophers: Plato (Book 3) and Epicurus (Book 10). The other books consist of multiple chapters, ranging from as few as six (Book 5, devoted to Aristotle and his successors) to as many as 17 (Book 2, which begins the account of the succession of "Ionian" philosophers, Axaminander, Anaximines, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus, followed by Socrates and his successors, completed by Plato in Book 3, the Academics in Book 4, Aristotelians in Book 5, the Cynics in Book 6, and the Stoics in Book 7). The account of the "Italian" succession begins in Book 8 with Pythagoras. Book 9 begins with an account of the so-called "sporadic" philosophers Heraclitus and Xenophanes; they cannot easily be affiliated with either the Ionian or Italian successions, although Xenophanes is absorbed into the "Italian" succession. These accounts are followed by the Eleatics, Parmenides and his followers Melissus and Zeno, and then the Atomists, Leucippus, Democritus, Protagoras, and Anaxarchus, followed by Pyrrho, and Pyrrho's follower Timon; the Italian succession is apparently completed by Epicurus (Book 10).Most of the chapters are structured to include the following information about an individual philosopher: (1) name and identity, including father's name and birthplace; (2) teachers (real or supposed); (3) chronology, according to presumed time of flourishing and contemporaries; (4) anecdotes about actions and behaviors, sometimes embodying and sometimes contradicting their beliefs or doctrines; (5) famous sayings (including maxims that may have been synthesized by later authors); and (6) a list of other people with the same name. For some philosophers, Laertius also provides further information, including: (7) a description of the philosopher's beliefs or doctrines (a doxography); and (8) a list of works (usually from library catalogues), (9) a will (usually considered genuine), or (10) letters (usually considered spurious).Laertius names a number of sources, including authors and titles of earlier works on the lives and successions of philosophers, but the issue of how many sources he actually used is a vexed one, and the nature of his processing and adaptation of his sources remains somewhat obscure. Nevertheless, Laertius' work is an indispensable source of information not only for his own earlier sources, but for several philosophers and entire philosophical movements (especially Stoicism and Epicureanism).The History of Philosophy as a subdiscipline of Philosophy generally focuses on the reconstruction and criticism of the doctrines and arguments of the philosophers. Our project focuses instead on the interactions between philosophers and the transmission of their doctrines and arguments through space and time. Laertius also turns out to be a great resource for this investigation---, and attempt to visualize and model ancient intellectual networks---perhaps an even greater source for this purpose than he is for reconstructing the philosophical beliefs and arguments of the ancient philosophers. Laertius provides a trove of information on the identity, teachers, students, chronology, anecdotes about interactions with other philosophers, and lists of works. Although this information must in each individual case be scrutinized with an appropriate degree of scholarly skepticism (commensurate with that employed in using this information to reconstruct beliefs and arguments), when the information is aggregated and considered as a whole it reveals both expected and unexpected results about the drivers and trends and clusters of intellectual activity in Classical and Hellenistic Greece.The Italian scholar T. Dorandi has produced a definitive edition of the Greek text of *Lives of Philosophers* based on his exhaustive study of the text and its transmission in the middle ages and renaissance. Recommended translations into English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German are recommended in the [Bibliography](http://diogenet.ucsd.edu/bibliography/). Laertius also wrote epigrammatic poetry. A collection of his poems entitled *Pammetros*, which may have been published in his own lifetime, has been lost. But some of these poems have survived because they were inserted into *Lives of Philosophers*, possibly by a later editor and not by Laertius himself. We do not utilize Laertius' own poetry, or his scheme of successions, in our database, which is otherwise entirely based on his *Lives of Philosophers*.
