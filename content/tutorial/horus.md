## Network Visualizations

With the help of [Horus](http://diogenet.ucsd.edu/horus/), you can visualize a **global** and **local** view of the networks, as well as search for intellectual communities. Each network that you can study in [Horus](http://diogenet.ucsd.edu/horus/) is built on a specific type of social tie that you can choose from the menu. Exploring each type of tie separately is important because a family network, for instance, is different from a network of friends or peer philosophers. The expectations, themes of conversation, and even patterns of behavior in each network were  articulated differently depending on  the type of social ties through which the actors were intertwined. What Axiothea of Phlius conversed with her father as a daughter was, most likely, not what she discussed with  Plato in the Academy.
