Diogenet is a research project of the Classics program at the University of California, San Diego. It is currently lead by Professors Jacobo Myerston and Monte Johnson and is being implemented by students of the Classics major.  The project is part of a larger investigation about the impact of social ties on the construction and diffusion of knowledge in ancient Greece.   We  have taken the book of Diogenes Laërtius  *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers*  as a starting point but we will add more sources in the future. We are currenty annotating this long and comprehensive history of philosophy that was written in the 3rd century CE but that attends to trace the succession of philosophical schools since its very beginnings in Greece. We are conducting the annotation of the text manually while identifying and marking relations between social actors. These do not only include philosophers but also their friends and family, as well as adversaries and patron. With the information resulting from the annotation process we are building a dataset that will be offered to the public in a future stage of the project.  Currently, we offer access to this data through three different network visualizations. Each of these views offer a different perspective of the networks described by Diogenes. In the sociocentric view, you can access the whole set of social actors and the ties that link them. In the egocentric view, you can focus on an specific social actors and his or her close relations. In community view, you can see the different comunities that formed the social actors in the network. This last view is particulary interesting because the comminities found by three different algorithms we offer do not coincide with the tradional categories of philophical schools. 

The main theoretical approach at the foundations of Diogenet is formal social network analysis, a branch of graph theory and sociology. Accordingly, we use the concept of nodes and ties to build a dataset of intellectuals and the relations between them. Conceptualizing social actors in this manner allows to approach problems of knowledge dissemination, brokerage, and  bottlenecks as well as the building of symbolic and social capital in a way that traditional history of ideas cannot.

## Networks of Philosohers 

Currently we offer an interactive visualization of the network of philosophers, their friends, and family as it was described by Diogenes Laërtius. The ancient historian of philosophy had access to many sources now unaccessible to us. However, his view of the network is a partial one and will need to be completed in the future with the addition to Diogenet of other ancient author who wrote about the lives of people engaged in the generation and transmission of ideas.

With the help of the interactive applications that you will find below, you can visualize  a global view of the network in different ways. You can choose three different types of ties that connect the actors in the network. For now these ties are teacher-disciple, friends, and family. In the future, we will add others types of ties as **letters sent** as well as **citations made**.  In a future phase, we plan to explore the role of geography in dynamics of ideas dissemination and appropriation by adding **ties to places** in order to identify intellectual hubs. To improve the visualization you can scroll with the mouse to zoom in and out the network view; changing the size of the label can improve readability.
