## Introduction
Diogenet is a research project of the Classics program of the University of California, San Diego, and is part of a larger investigation about the impact of social ties on the construction and diffusion of knowledge in ancient Greece. 
The main theoretical approach at the foundations of Diogenet is formal social network analysis, a branch of graph theory and sociology. Accordingly, we use the concepts of nodes and ties to build a dataset of intellectuals of the ancient world and the ties that linked them. Conceptualizing ancient intellectual life in this manner allows approaching problems of knowledge dissemination and brokerage, as well as the building of symbolic and social capital in a way that is novel in history of ideas. 
The source of our current dataset is the book  *Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers* that the Greek author Diogenes Laertius wrote in the 3rd century CE. Currently we offer an interactive visualization of the network that Diogenes describe in some details. To make sense of the visualization some background in the history of ancient Greek philosophy is necessary. For this reason we recommend using the visualization tools in conjunction with Diogenesâ€™ text which is available in various editions in Greek and translation ([see Bibliography]({{< ref "bibliography" >}})). 

##  Network Visualization
With the help of the interactive application that you find below, you can visualize a global view of the network in different ways. You can choose three different types of ties that connect the nodes in the network. For now, these ties are teacher-disciple, friends, and family. In the future, we will add other types of ties denoting who *send letters to whom*, who *cited* and *read* whom, among others. You can scroll with the mouse to zoom in and out the network view; changing the size of the labels can improve readability.

### Local Networks

In this site, you can access the Diogenet Network from different perspectives or views.  While the *Global View* of the network is important to gain a perspective of the overall extension of the structure, the *Local View* allows to focus on one specific node (currenly only human actors) and their neighbors.  The variable *Order* of the *Local View* determines the distance between *Ego* and its neighbors. Setting *Order* to 1 will return only the node choosen in the pop-up menu *Node*; setting it to 2 will return *Ego* and its neighbors at 2 steps from *Ego*.

###  Communities

With the help of different algorithms and the use of the library igraph, it is possible to identify **communities** in Diogenet. A community is a cohesive group of social actors. We offer here three different algorithms you can choose from. Some of them, for example, the **Cluster Louvain** algorithm not only identifies communities but the bridges that establish a path of communication between them.  In social network analysis,  a **bridge** is a tie that connects two components or communities. In the present visualization of communities bridges are highlighted with red ties.

At the end of each bridge, there are nodes that control the flow of ideas and information in general between communities. Those nodes are brokers of special importance for understanding the structure of the network. A broker can act as a facilitator between two or more communities of intellectuals but can also capitalize such a position by restricting the flow of communication between communities and thus claiming a special social status as a consequence of his/her mediation.  Brokers can act then both as mediators and bottlenecks, and because they are connected to different sources of knowledge they  can synthesize divergent intellectual positions and capitalize their syntheses as innovations.
